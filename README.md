"# FTEModFix" 


This is a modified version of SeventeenV's ForTheEmperor Darktide Mod that prevents the added pings from firing while in menus. Not uploaded to Nexusmods because I don't wanna deal with any copyright/licensing/etc. bullshit.

How to use:
- Click the green code button.
- Click download zip.
- Extract into your darktide mods folder.
- You should end up with a folder named FTEModFix-main
- Open that folder
- - You might have another FTBModFix-main folder inside depending on how you extracted it. If so, open that one now.
- Move the ForTheEmperor folder to your mods folder. This is the fixed mod.
- - If you currently have the ForTheEmeperor mod from NexusMods, delete that, then move the fixed mod to your mods folder.
